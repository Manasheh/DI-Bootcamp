# Exercise 1 > In the python shell, Create a variable called my_age, use python to know how old you will be in 123879 years

# my_age = 28
# my_future_age = 123879 + my_age
# print(my_future_age)

# # Exercise 2 > In the python shell, Create a variable called first_name and a variable called last_name, and then print your full name using those two variables

# first_name = 'Menashe'
# last_name = 'Vaiphei'
# print(first_name, last_name)

#Type casting


# years_in_israel = 'one'
# #to convert to number
