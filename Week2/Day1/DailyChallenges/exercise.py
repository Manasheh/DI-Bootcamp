#Exercise 1:
# Ask the user for a 
# number between 1 and 100

# If the number is a multiple of three, print "Fizz"

# If the number is a multiple of five, print "Buzz".

# If the number is a multiple is a multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz" instead.

# user_choice = int(input('Enter a number between 1 and 100 '))

# print(f"Your entered {user_choice}")
# if user_choice % 3 == 0 and user_choice % 5 == 0 :
#      print('Fizzbuzz')
# elif user_choice % 5 == 0:
#      print('Buzz')
# elif user_choice % 3 == 0:
#      print('Fizz')
# # print(6 + 4)
# print(type('1212' * 2))

# Exercise 1 > In the python shell, Create a variable called my_age, use python to know how old you will be in 123879 years

# my_age = 28
# my_future_age = 123879 + my_age
# print(my_future_age)

# # Exercise 2 > In the python shell, Create a variable called first_name and a variable called last_name, and then print your full name using those two variables

# first_name = 'Menashe'
# last_name = 'Vaiphei'
# print(first_name, last_name)

#Type casting


# years_in_israel = 'one'
# #to convert to number
# years_future = int(years_in_israel) + 10
# print(years_future)

#concatenate string using f string:
# first_name = 'Menashe'
# last_name = 'Vaiphei'
# print(f'My name is {first_name} {last_name}')

#INPUT 

# age = input('What is your age ?')
# print(f'My age is {type(age)}')

# if int(age) > 18:
#     print('you can come to the pub !')
