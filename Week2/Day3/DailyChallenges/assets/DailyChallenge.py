# Ask a user for a word
# Write a program that creates a dictionary. This dictionary stores the indexes of each letter in a list.

# Make sure the letters are the keys.
# Make sure the letters are strings.
# Make sure the indexes are stored in a list and those lists are values.

# user_word = input('Enter a word ')
# my_dict = {}

# for index, letter in enumerate(user_word):
#     # print(letter, index)
#     if letter in my_dict:
#         my_dict[letter].append(index)
#     else:
#         my_dict[letter] = [index]
# print(my_dict)


# Create a program that prints a list of the items you can afford in the store with the money you have in your wallet.
# Sort the list in alphabetical order.
# Return “Nothing” if you can’t afford anything from the store.

#THE SECOND ONE IS KIND OF HARD FOR ME
